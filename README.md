### ERRORS, WARNINGS & DRAWBACKS         
    * Do not mix up calculation signs as this either brings 0 as solution or NaN error.
        >for example a coomputation like `6*/8` this will bring you a NaN error
    * The calculator has not yet been linked to desktop keyboard so currently it is an on screen calculator
    *After a NaN error you have to press the AC button so that it should be removed because currently
     the option of just clicking a number has not been added
    *answer was created as a reference point and its removal later created multiple bugs hence it was left and just minimised
