# Calculator
*The Calculator App is a user-friendly and versatile tool designed to perform basic mathematical operations with ease. Whether you need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers, this calculator has got you covered.*  
### DEVELOPMENT
    1. The calculator was coded using the array method and not the variable method which is commonly used for development. 
      This was one to show uniqueness and comprehesive programming skills
    2. Pseudocode was developed using a flowchart so that ideas were easily refracted.
    3. All the development including the User interface was designed by the coder

### ERRORS, WARNINGS & DRAWBACKS         
    1 .Do not mix up calculation signs as this either brings 0 as solution or NaN error.
        for example a computation like `6*/8` this will bring you a NaN error
    2 .The calculator has not yet been linked to desktop keyboard so currently it is an on screen calculator
    3 .After a NaN error you have to press the AC button so that it should be removed because currently
     the option of just clicking a number has not been added
    4.answer was created as a reference point and its removal later created multiple bugs hence it was left 
       and just minimised
